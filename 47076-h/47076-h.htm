<p>G. G. Gervinus (1805-1871) is recognized as one of the
foremost historians of Germany. He was a man of marvelous
erudition. His fame rests not only upon a great number
of profoundly learned works, but also upon his brilliant advocacy
of the constitutional rights of the people, as against the
reactionary tendency of the German princes during Metternich’s
despotic rule. He was one of the seven celebrated
professors of the University of Göttingen who boldly protested
against the violation of the Constitution by the King of
Hanover. His best-known works are “<cite>History of the Poetical
Literature of the Germans</cite>,” “<cite>History of the Nineteenth
Century</cite>,” and a voluminous commentary on Shakspeare,
“made popular in England”&mdash;as the <cite>Encyclopædia Britannica</cite>
states&mdash;“by an excellent translation.”</p>

<p>The following sketch was designed by Gervinus as an outline
of what a history of potology would be, if conceived and
executed by a philosophical mind.</p>

<p>An English translation of this sketch needs no justification
in our time.

<span class="sub_head">A HISTORICAL SKETCH.</span></h2>

<p>A sketch of the art of drinking might seem to announce a
subject unworthy of a man whose energies have been devoted
to earnest purposes and serious aims in life. But it is not my
intention to make the sketch a mere treasure-box of all sorts
of curiosities, nor to gratify thereby the curiosity of idle
readers. When it is approached from a scientific standpoint,
the dignity of science must necessarily exclude all frivolous
treatment, as well as all shallow and superficial purpose.
Many would be satisfied if an insignificant sketch of this
kind simply bore some pathetic motto, as these words of
Seneca’s: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Animum aliquando debemus relaxare et quibusdam
oblectamentis reficere; sed ipsa oblectamenta opera sint.</span>
I, however, would scorn a justification of this kind, for I hold
that recreation ought to be recreation, and not work, and
should consider it far better if our labors were pleasures, rather
than our pleasures, labors.</p>

<p>I wish in this sketch to point out the importance and serious
significance of a work of this sort, and shall have, above all, to
prove that the apparently somewhat jocular subject has a very
serious side, and may be contemplated from a grave standpoint.</p>

<p>If I succeed from the very first in inducing the reader to
adopt the same historical view of the matter that I take myself,
I shall have gained a great point, for he will then lay
aside all prejudice and preconceived opinion. The real historian
must be a stranger to all prejudice and preconceived
opinion; he cannot treat of any subject separately, but is attracted
by everything in a certain order and connection. He
must not choose any subject from personal inclination, but
according to the needs and demands of his time and of human
society; nor must he treat the chosen subject with that pathological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
interest and sympathy so common among the writers
of the New World. He must understand and know, from
historical experience, that in times like ours, which have outgrown
the activity of imagination&mdash;that is to say, <em>Art</em>&mdash;and,
on the other hand, are not yet ripe for speculation&mdash;that is to
say, <em>Philosophy</em>,&mdash;universal observation, which includes all departments
of human activity, is the only thing that in these very
times and for this generation can furnish positive information
and prove a certain gain. The real historian, whose profession
it is to be equally interested in everything, thus becomes an
image of impartiality. The impartial observer is attracted by
all phenomena, and to him nothing appears small, insignificant
or unimportant, as soon as he begins to draw conclusions from
his observations and to discover laws in the physical as well as
the moral world. In the world of reason there exists nothing
small, accidental or unimportant. If the same laws of chemical
combination govern immense masses of matter as well as
the smallest atom, if the march and development of mankind
are the same as those of the most insignificant individual, the
observation of the smallest as well as the greatest is of equal
importance, and man may well feel comfort in the fact that
each hair upon his head is, indeed, numbered. This alone
might refute any serious objection to my theme.</p>

<p>A history of oinology or potology would be able to show
that man, in satisfying a partly physical and partly intellectual
desire, is bound by the same laws that govern him in the
satisfaction of the highest needs of his striving mind. And if
this be the case, the theme might be considered worthy of
being chosen by the most severe scientific moralist; and matters
of this kind are apt to be overlooked only because other
things appear comparatively more important. There is a history
of wine and wine-drinking (for of these alone I speak),
because it is connected with our spiritual development.
Wine itself shows a certain element of development and perfectibility&mdash;a
relation to organic life in its fermentation, and
a sympathetic feeling, as it were, in its movement during the
period of the blooming of the vine, while in the plant itself
it shows an inner development. I have just called wine-drinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
a partly physical, partly intellectual enjoyment, and it is
almost impossible to call up the image of any social gathering or
entertainment without it. And since all human culture proceeds
from the manners and forms of society and social intercourse,
we would plainly see in such a history&mdash;what has often been
divined and pointed out, but also frequently smiled at&mdash;that
wine is most closely connected with the civilization of States and
with the development of free human culture, and that the art
of drinking at all times keeps step with this culture and development,
and sinks or rises with them. For not at all times
have men practiced this art with equal wisdom, nor yet even
practiced it in like manner; and there is spiritual progress
from the blood-thirsty revels of Ægisthe to those of the philosophers
with Plato; from the cup-bearer Hephæstos to Hebe
and Ganymede; from the heavy, dull metal cup to the transparent,
rounded crystal glass, in Lucian’s time, or our own,
which shows the color, retains the perfume and promotes
sound. <em>As the culture of the grape is only found where a
higher human civilization has begun to develop, it also shows
itself at once where a new civilization appears; it may be
even in regions unfavorable to it, where it is only cultivated
till wine has become so great a want that it can no
longer be dispensed with, despite the lack of sufficient native
production.</em> The first cultivators of the vine, history praises
as benefactors of mankind and propagators of civilization.
Noah was the elect of God, in spite of the improprieties
produced by his wine; old Dionysos, for all the ravings of
his service, a kindly god; and Urban, of the Middle Ages, a
saint, although he committed the greatest misdeeds under the
influence of wine. And wherever, on the other hand, in more
enlightened history, a man took an active part in the development
of human civilization, he did so also instinctively, it
would seem, for that of wine&mdash;be it a Heracles Ipoctonos among
the Erythræans; or an Alexander, who, with his Greek
culture, brought the grape-vine back to hot Babylon; or a
Charles <abbr title="the fourth">IV.</abbr>, who, with his Italian education, wished to force
it upon cold Bohemia. We shall see that wherever hierarchical
constitutions deprived the people of the advantages of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
education, the wisdom of the priests was subtle enough to
forbid wine too, and the course of the Mohammedan hierarchy
will show us most plainly how the art of drinking brought
with it bold reformatory deviations from the laws. We shall
observe, even with Christian nations, how, among certain
races where the use of wine was confined to the Communion
table, civilization also came to a stand-still. We can then
point to a patriarchal and heroic period of the art of drinking,
where wine, as was formerly done by the Gauls, and even by
our own Suabian ancestors, was despised, and afterwards, by
all sorts of artificial means, made more substantial than it is
by nature&mdash;more like mead or beer, which is at such periods
the natural drink of the people. At an aristocratic and
knightly epoch, in which society is unnaturally sublimated, it
is sought to increase and make more spiritual still the effect of
wine also, by the addition of spicy herbs. With the first civil
development of nations they return to simple nature; a number
of corporations and brotherhoods make it their business to
watch over the art of drinking, over the purity of the wine
itself, and its lawful use; from king to beggar, all cultivate
the cheering art, just as all are anxious, also, for spiritual enlightenment.
We see, then, in the last centuries the pedantic
return to tea and coffee, and among those nations who have
shared but in very small measure in the intellectual progress
of Europe, we find that the coffee-house (café)&mdash;an institution
which is scarcely a century and a half old&mdash;almost crowded
out the wine-saloons.</p>

<p>I have alluded to wine-drinking as a partly intellectual and
partly physical enjoyment. Among material enjoyments, it
is one of the most spiritual; among spiritual ones, one of
the most material, keeping about the right middle course. A
history of the art of drinking would prove this. Everywhere
in the history of nations we shall come upon times where
amid a fulness of physical power, the desire for more refinement
in outward life, as well as a striving for greater inner
perfection, began to manifest itself. In Germany, the
time of the Reformation was such a period. And at such
times, when outer and inner powers begin to stir with wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
energy&mdash;times as yet divided between old roughness and
new humanity; between the coarse, ordinary fare of every
day for mind and imagination, and the new hope of some finer
nourishment&mdash;at such times the genial enjoyment of wine, and
the delights of regular social pleasures, have always struck
deepest root and had freest play. Such images as those, this
history would most willingly depict; nor would it be superfluous
to present them in our day, when society seems more
and more to forget that its aim is to be simply pleasure and
recreation. The future seems to offer nothing that could take
the place of the great simplicity of past manners; of those
feasts of youth which asked nothing but uncontrolled enjoyment;
of those evening entertainments of the citizens, which
were devoted to their immediate surroundings in house or
community; of the frank and manly rectitude of that race
which seemed, indeed, to find truth and constancy in wine,
and its best pleasures in an afternoon spent in the “wine-garden,”
surrounded by wife and children, relatives and
friends. All public pleasure has disappeared from among us,
and we arrange parties and receptions that only tire ourselves
and others. Ceremonious etiquette gives us work and trouble
when we should find recreation, and fatigues our minds when
imagination should have free play. Only where men, here
and there, permit themselves to meet about the bottle, according
to the good old custom, and where no committee is necessary
to approve of the toasts, pure, genuine pleasure revives
once more, together with the pure, genuine art of drinking.
For there is no intellectual power that is so directly quickened
and strengthened by any nourishment as imagination is by
wine. Tea keeps conversation within the bounds of pedantic
propriety, and beer soothes but checks quick repartee; but wine
sharpens the sting of wit, stimulates spirited conversation, and
brightens the whole social atmosphere. The poet, who lives
in imagination, and turns his back upon reality, was always a
lover of wine&mdash;the beverage which intensifies reality, and, at
the same time, lifts him above it. The drinking-song, from
Anacreon down to all his imitators in Germany, occupies a
special and very prominent place in literature. To wine are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
dedicated the first productions of the tragic art; and to it has
been assigned a particular dithyrambic measure, which a poet
who should set water above wine could never soar high
enough to make his own. And whosoever has any cause to
turn away from the real world, and longs for the freedom of
living in an ideal one, is fond of wine. If I wished to spoil
my idyllic picture by satire, I should here name the converts
and the monks; but I should rather call up the wandering
beggar, whom want and hardship have made weary of the
world. Sleep has been praised as the friend of poverty; but
there were times when wine also was called its friend, which,
even in waking hours, calls up dreams that charm away the
burden of a miserable existence. For wine tempts even the
beggar to extravagance, that vice which has often been set
down to the account of wine; although, if there be such a
thing as degrees in vice, it may be called one of the nobler
ones. And this genial pleasure in spending helps the poor
man in his misery; consoles him for his destitution; offers
him who is homeless a spot where he may feel comfortable,
and teaches him to forget all that oppresses him. Wine makes
man liberal and generous; the offered cup was formerly
the symbol of hospitality granted, and even the miser is more
ready to share tobacco and wine than any of his other possessions.
For it makes us communicative and confidential in
social intercourse; it founds friendships, and is still the symbol
of brotherhood. If it sometimes stirs up heat and dissension,
it also smooths the way to union again; and, formerly,
no reconciliation could take place without having a seal set
upon it by a common cup of wine. At your cup you find the
freest and most enlightened spot in the world, where you may
not only think what you please, and say what you think, but
where your thoughts themselves take the highest flight man is
capable of. I do not know whether it is due to jealous gods
that the excessive enjoyment of wine proves its own penalty.
Without this depressing fire in the wine itself, it seems to me
heaven and its secrets would be far more endangered by the
spiritual flight of the drinker than by the towering rocks of
the Titans. Thus, wherever despots and hierarchs intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
to keep nations in drowsy stupidity, they forbade wine. Only
at times, when liberty and enlightenment were common property,
when no castes possessed an exclusive monoply of
wisdom, right or might, was it possible to introduce political
discussion at the cup. For only at such times of universal
public spirit and feeling could one take counsel of the imagination
in practical affairs and matters of State, and hope
for such results of the evening discussion at the cup as would
bear the test of the sober next day’s light. For only such heroic
conditions as are represented by the Germans and Persians of
ancient times can really show the virtues of truth and faithfulness,
and in the most public concerns could hear the voice
that always speaks in wine; and, in those days, no one needed
to fear that wine would impel him to speak truth too freely.
Only nations of really active nature, who called manliness and
war-power by the name of virtue, could do full honor to wine,
and it could only be a Greek who asked, as did Aristophanes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">“Dost thou boldly venture to say wine is not good for our reason?<br /></div>
    <div class="p_line">What more than wine impels us to deeds and to action?</div>
    <div class="p_line">Why, look you, as soon as men are drinkers of wine, then</div>
    <div class="p_line">Rich are they all and active, victorious in law-courts;</div>
    <div class="p_line">Aye, very happy too, and to their friends useful.”</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Among the Germans, too, it has long been customary to
settle all business with a drink, and there was no betrothal, no
bargain, and no compact that was not accompanied by the
purchase of wine. All German history is filled with the love
of wine. When the German border-line was first drawn, the
Germans insisted on keeping the left bank of the Rhine, on
account of its richness in grapes. They wrote books about
the national disposition to drink; they divided their history
according to drinking periods, and old proverbs call the love
of drink the German national vice, as theft is that of the
Spaniards, deceit that of the Italians, and vanity that of the
French. Nowhere exist wines so capable of purity as the
German wines, and no real German will ever compare with
their genuine wine-qualities those of the tricky southern
wines; and nowhere have mixtures been so carefully avoided,
as well as the purity of the art of drinking, and the old drinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
customs so scrupulously preserved, as in Germany. Only
in Germany could be conceived the idea of a history of the art
of drinking. Perhaps the fates have ordained me to be the
historian of wine, in the very meaning of my name&mdash;ger-wîn,
not gêr-wîn. And perhaps some readers may be found for it
in Germany who do not consider it too indelicate to speak or
to read of the natural needs of man. Let man never, in foolish
pride, think himself above his own natural wishes and enjoyments,
for it is the reasonable care given to these which
keeps him close to human nature. As long as a people cannot
live on newspaper reading and on staring about in public
places, as do Frenchmen and Italians, it keeps its hands busy,
its powers actively employed, and its eyes open, and wherever
active powers are astir, no nation is in so very bad a condition.
I should be well content if I could bring before active and
manly minds a cheerful picture of those manly enjoyments,
and induce them to taste of this somewhat coarser fare, in
addition to the delicate dishes of our literature.</p>

<span class="small_head">The Fatherland of Wine.</span></h2>


<p>I would only here and there touch upon the botanical and
industrial culture of the grape, as many very valuable works on
the subject already exist (among others, Henderson’s “<cite>History
of Ancient and Modern Wines</cite>”), which make almost a complete
literature of wine. I shall also speak of the home of the
grape only for the sake of preserving the natural order of
things, and shall touch later upon the mythical origin of wine,
or the preparation of wine. If we look for the original
country of the grape, we shall find that here, too, as in almost
every other branch of culture, the western highlands of Asia
are pointed out to us, whether we follow the fable of Father
Noah, the Nysæan Bacchus, or the researches of the naturalists.
The latter teach us that on the Canary Isles and in
America the grape grows not so much wild as in a degenerate
condition; but in the southwest of Europe, for instance the
Italian woods, it is here and there found growing really wild;
that in the southeast this is still more common, and in Asia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
ever on the increase. It is singular that at the Ararat, to which
Jewish tradition also points, Tournefort, in his “<cite>Journey to
the Levant</cite>,” discovered a regular workshop of the European
plant, and on the borders of transcaucasian Georgia he saw the
land covered with wild grape-vines and fruit-trees. In the
Caucasus, Marshall found the grape flourishing independently
in the forest and covering whole trees, and we see in the rough
and indifferent manner in which the inhabitants of these countries
harvest and treat the grape that they consider it a very
common product. The manner in which they preserve the
wine, and the quantity they daily consume, prove the same,
and this entirely agrees with what Xenophon tells of the
preservation of the wine in cisterns. Elphinstone, in his
report on Cabul, relates that the Sultan presented him with
grapes that grew without cultivation in his country. And not
only the quantities of the wild grapes in those countries
induce us to regard them as their native soil, it is also the
excellent quality of the cultivated grape in Persia. The quantity
and quality of the Persian wine opposed in this respect an
effective barrier to the laws of the Koran, which enjoined
against the enjoyment of the beverage, even in the Orient,
which is so set in its religious rites and ceremonies. Olivier
preferred the grapes about Ispahan to all he had tasted in
Greece, on the islands of the Mediterranean, and in Syria.
None, he says, equals the <i>Kismish</i>, which bears a berry of
middling size, without seeds and with a thin skin. Shiraz,
rich in poets, is celebrated on account of the excellence and
plenty of its wine and its fine air, and Morier, in his
“<cite>Journey through Persia</cite>,” places the wine of Kazwin even
above that of Shiraz, and the former city is so beautifully
situated in so mild a climate that the Persians have given it
the name of “Paradise.” In regard to the fruitfulness of
the vine, Strabo tells us that in Hyrcania <em>one</em> vine was
apt to yield about thirty-three quarts of wine. In Margiana
were said to be vines measuring at the base of the stem two
fathoms in circumference and bearing grapes two yards long.
In Asia the fruitfulness is said to be still greater, and there
the wine keeps, in unpitched vessels, through three generations.</p>

<p>The course from east to west, marked by the higher culture
of the human race, has been also closely followed by the
culture of the grape. Other regions, north and south from
the boundary marked out, may have had a certain share in
that civilization; but it seems now to be proved that the
negro races, the original inhabitants of Africa, have not in
any way been connected with it. In those regions of Africa
always inhabited by these races, no grape-culture is, up to the
present day, to be found; and, both in ancient and modern
times, the grape has been a stranger in Africa, and a stranger
scarcely to be called naturalized anywhere. To that king of
the long-lived Ethiopians in Herodotus, to whom Cambyses
sent his gifts, wine, therefore, seemed the only desirable thing
they possessed, and to it he ascribed the brief old age which, in
the best case, it was given the Persians to attain. His negroes,
therefore, were not acquainted with wine, and in this they were
like all uncivilized people, as we shall frequently see; nor did
they ever accept it, any more than they accepted any other part
of civilization; they never advanced any further than to their
<i>Towak</i>, the palm-wine made of flower-stems; even the lotus-wine,
of the preparation of which Herodotus knew, seems to
belong only to the Libyans. Only emigrants, in the most
ancient as well as most recent times, have introduced the
grape-vine at different times into Africa, and we will briefly
glance at this. First, the Egyptians must be named, Caucasian
races not autochthonically at home in Libya. The ancient
culture of the grape in Egypt is proved not only by historical
documents, but even by the ruins of old buildings, and I
shall return to the paintings in the vaults near El Kab,
which represent, among other things, the manner of gathering
the grapes, and of preserving and cooling the wine.
Several regions are specially mentioned as celebrated for their
wine. Eleithya had grape-culture; the lakes of Mareos and
Taenia, where all is now a barren desert, were commended for
their wine; Alexandria exported wine to Rome, and Horace is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
acquainted with that of Mareos. To the Epicureans, however,
the Falernian wine seemed better when treated in the Egyptian
manner; and the wine of Taenia was considered stronger
and spicier than the Alexandrian. But even in the time of
Ahenæos this culture had almost disappeared, and only that
of Antylla still had a good name in those days. And even in
better times, the native wine does not seem to have sufficed for
home consumption, for Herodotus speaks at length of imported
wine from Hellas and Phœnicia. The Libyans and Berbers
probably never knew a grape-culture of their own without
foreign aid. It is certain that in old times the colonies of the
Greeks and Carthagenians in the north of Africa were full of
the grape; and we shall find further on that the cult of
Bacchus was widespread in Cyrenaica, and that traces of it
still remain in the ruins. Pliny speaks of vineyards as traces
of ancient civilization in the mountains of Dyris (Atlas); and
there are still, more for the sake of the grapes than the wine,
vineyards near Tunis, in the rich district of Derna, as well as
the poor one of Mafa, in Fezzan. In Mauritania, as Strabo
reports, were found grapes a yard in circumference. In the
oases, Belzoni saw grapes, and in that of Siwah they are excellent,
as other southern fruit also. In recent times the Portuguese
brought the grape, with other fruit, as well to
Madeira and the Canary Isles as to Abyssinia. There the
poorness of the plant itself, no less than the peculiar use of it,
shows plainly what a stranger it is. Thus, also, among the
Griquas it is cultivated by the missionaries only, who, confining,
as they are wont, all civilization which they offer to the
elements of Christian religion, give to grape-culture also only
a Christian significance, planting the vine merely for its use
at the Communion table. The celebrated Cape wine is a
different matter. Enlightened French emigrants, Protestants
driven from home by the Edict of Nantes, first planted the grape
there; but it is not certain whether the vines came both from
Persia and from the Rhine, or only from Shiraz. The climate
seems there to favor the culture of the grape extremely; the
soil, however, appears most unfavorable, and Colebrooke, in
his work on the condition of the Cape of Good Hope, ascribes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the earthy taste, which makes the Cape wines unpleasant, to a
substratum of the soil, otherwise rather good, consisting in
many places of layers of clay and sand that has been washed
up. And what is not spoiled by the soil, seems to have been
spoiled by the indolence of the Dutchmen, or some other disadvantage
with which the African country is cursed. A sort
of fairy-tale is told of the totally wrong manner of planting
the first vineyard; and still not even the example of the far
better Constantia wine has induced men to make vineyards in
rockier spots.</p>

<h2 title= "III.The Degenerate Culture of the Grape and the Art of
Drinking in China.">III.<br />

<span class="small_head">The Degenerate Culture of the Grape and the Art of
Drinking in China.</span></h2>

<p>If the learned men of China can be trusted, the grape-vine
must have been known in their country more than a
thousand years B. C. They refer to this in old books, the
“<cite>Tshu-ly</cite>” and the “<cite>Shi-King</cite>;” but as to the latter, that
seems everywhere to refer to the wine made of various grains,
which is almost exclusively used in China.</p>

<p>At all events, it seems to be proved by the most trustworthy
witnesses that rice-wine is older in China than the wine of
grapes; for while the highest age that can be assigned to wine is
only given by the doubtful testimony of the supposed author
of the <cite>Tshu-ly</cite>,” Tshu-Kang, who mounted the throne
1122 B. C., the invention of rice-wine is set down to the
Dynasty Hia, 2209 (1716 B. C.). This also accords with experience
elsewhere, for beer of various kinds (and the grain-wines
of the Chinese are nothing else, except that they frequently
mix them with all sorts of fruit, including grapes)
everywhere became the national drink in advance of wine, as
brandy and other liquors follow wine. Grape-brandy has, it
appears, been known in China only since the seventh century of
our era, but is now a favorite beverage with the common Chinamen,
and is drunk by them warm and almost as strong as
alcohol in large quantities, in spite of its very unpleasant
taste. For only a comparatively short time the grape-culture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
seems to have flourished in China. The Chinese always
have had their grain-wines and their brandy more at heart.
The inventor of the rice-wine was, it is true, banished by the
Emperor Yu-te, because he well foresaw the sad consequences
of its use, and yet the beverage has kept its place to the
present day as an ornament of the Chinese table. It is like
this people, who live on nothing but that water-plant, rice, and
tea, to cling with the same obstinacy as they do to all old
orders and customs, to this beverage, which is something
between brandy and water, and taken neither hot nor cold.
These wines are said to have a very bad effect; they fatten at
first, but then bring on consumption, entire loss of appetite,
and at last complete emaciation and death. It was
natural, therefore, that the paternal Emperors, who looked
after their subjects as after real children, and in whose laws
dietetics always played a great part, should forbid these injurious
beverages, and several of the Emperors set the good
example. The third Emperor of the Dynasty Mant-shu,
Yong-Tsheng, devoted one of his ten commandments to this
subject, and the great Kanghi says in his writings that, despite
his pleasure in them, he never became accustomed to wine and
spirits. At feasts and banquets he only touched it with his
lips, and so might well boast of not drinking any at all.
Moreover, this wine consumes a great deal of grain, which in
a densely peopled country, whose very existence depends upon
its supplies of grain, is a matter of some importance, so that
perhaps from this higher standpoint also there was good
reason for the prohibition. But the most important reason
lies deeper still, and was still more carefully considered; and
as this chiefly concerns the wine from grapes, we must
first cast another glance at grape-culture.</p>

<p>We have seen above that grapes existed of old in China.
The just-mentioned learned, philosophical and humane
Kanghi himself shows, in his remarks on natural history in
China, that grapes came to China from the West, and
that before his time but few kinds had existed in China,
and boasts that he had sent for three new varieties to Ha-mi,
as he would rather introduce a new fruit into his country than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
build a hundred porcelain towers. He observes, also, that
these grapes degenerate in the south, but do well in the
north in dry and stony soil. The experiences of the missionaries
in Pekin, however, were unfavorable; the soil was
against them, as well as the remarkably rough climate, and
possibly they went to work awkwardly in other respects also.
For it is certain that these very southern provinces once had
many grape-vines, and the wine made in Shan-si, Shen-si,
Petshe-ly, Shantong, Honan and Hu-Kuang, put into well-closed
vessels and buried in the ground, could be preserved
for years. This goes to prove an observation we shall often
find repeated, that after a time the most favorable soil no
longer suffices for the grape, which demands a certain youthful
power in the soil in which it is to flourish most luxuriantly.
In the older and middle ages of China we therefore
find the grape-wine mentioned in all their songs, and that of
the river Kiang is specially praised. It is known that at
different periods vines were introduced from Samarcand,
Persia, Thibet, Kashgar, Turfu and Ha-mi, and the annals
themselves plainly mention wine under the reign of Emperor
Wu-ty, Dynasty Han, 140 B. C. From there we can follow
up its use almost from reign to reign, and after the already-mentioned
Kanghi, the last dynasty shows still more rulers who
introduced new grapes from distant countries, so that the
southern provinces begin to restore their old grape-culture
again. But the grapes in Ha-mi and Shan-si seem mostly
to be used for raisins, and what we occasionally hear of
their condition in Hoai-lai-hien&mdash;that their berries are of
gigantic size, like plums, with a thick skin, and that their
size is not so much due to the climate as to the fact that the
vines are grafted on mulberry-trees, and that they ripen as
early as April, May and June&mdash;all this seems highly characteristic
of a degenerate culture, and gives us the poorest
possible opinion of the wine that might be made there.
Highly, therefore, as the Jesuits attempt to praise grape-culture
in China, we can yet have but little belief in it; but in
the Middle Ages it must have been all the more brilliant. The
reports concerning it are, however, wrapped in a certain obscurity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
from which no fact stands out clearly. The grape, it
is said, flourished only too well in China&mdash;it caused various
revolutions. As often as the Government had ordered the
destruction of such trees as obstructed the grain-fields, the useless
grape-vine was also included, and, if memory served the
reporters, that plant was several times specially mentioned.
It is certain that the destruction of the vine in most of the
provinces, under various reigns, was carried so far that even
the recollection of it was lost, and this induced the belief
that the grape had been brought to China but recently from
the Occident. It is plain that there was always a pretense
put forward that the grape-wine detracted from the culture of
the grain, although, with some care, the same area might
probably have yielded a nobler beverage than was made of the
rice and barley, grown where the grape had been rooted out.
But the intellectual effect of it was evidently feared. In so
regular a clock-work as the Chinese State, what might be
more dangerous than irregular movements so very easily produced
by wine in the heads of people? Even the making
of the grape-wine was often prohibited. When that did not
avail, its use was limited to feasts, banquets and sacrifices, and
to guests and infirm old age. Not enough with this, at such
feasts a special Mandarin was set over even the princes of the
blood to keep watch over and not permit them to drink more
than three glasses. And still more, certain ceremonies were
prescribed, long healths and salutations, circumstantial rites,
at which a free-thinker, as the Jesuits say, may laugh, but in
which a philosopher must admire the wisdom of the lawgiver,
and the subtlety with which he banished intemperance,
and that injudicious freedom of speech which is its inseparable
companion, from among the people! We have seen the
effects of grain-wine in China. The wise Emperor Kanghi
complains that it makes one stupid and dull and confuses the
brain. And how much more terrible still must have been the
effect of the grape-wine! This is probably meant in a certain
book of the Dynasty Tshu, where it is said in warning explanation
of the well-founded apprehensions of the Chinese
Government, that if a spirit of rebellion and insurrection was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
then rife among the people of China, if they had lost much
of their old virtues and principles, the cause of it must be
sought solely in the effects of wine. Away, therefore, with
that cursed boldness which betrays a tongue set free by wine;
that noisy action and damnable confidence in one’s own
strength; that rising of the spirit, which must have appeared
to the learned Emperor as synonymous with confusion; the
impudent overstepping of the good old laws of etiquette; the
wild breaking away from the good old ruts! How should
not all this, which was inseparably connected with wine, seem
to the philosophical head of the State in his immovable peace
and calmness, and to the council of his ministerial pedants,
extremely dangerous to the State, and worthy of being annihilated
to the last trace? Need we be surprised, therefore,
at the stories of abstinence told of the Emperors? It was
their duty to give a good example to the people. Had not
their prophet, Confucius, left these words of moderation&mdash;that
coarse rice for food, and water for drink, and the curved
arm for a pillow, were enough for happiness!</p>

<p>And thus the Governments of China succeeded in establishing,
even in very early times, a condition of submissive
decency everywhere. They confined wine to festive occasions,
and we learn from the “<cite>Shi-King</cite>” that to the guest
was granted the honor of the cup; even to him, however,
in but the spare measure that chimes with the sordid miserliness
of the Chinaman, who could never have understood the
art of drinking, if for no other reason than because he has
nothing of the liberality which the Orient calls the “flowing
hand.” They say in a guest-song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">“A noble guest has come beneath our roof;</div>
    <div class="p_line">For him melodious tunes were played,</div>
    <div class="p_line">So long as thus it pleased our guest,</div>
    <div class="p_line">And with the cup I sought to cheer him.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">“The sound of music rang incessantly,</div>
    <div class="p_line">And ever was the cup kept full;</div>
    <div class="p_line">And in our honor did he empty it;</div>
    <div class="p_line">The wine was light and pure, and harmed him not.”</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>
<p class="cont">And in another place:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">“A hare is roasting on the spit;</div>
    <div class="p_line">A pumpkin leaf we go to pick;</div>
    <div class="p_line">A banquet we prepare our guest,</div>
    <div class="p_line">And fill his cup with wine the best.”</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>We have seen from other authorities that wine was chiefly
reserved to old age, and here it is confirmed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">“Serve round the circle the wine-cup, ye bearers;</div>
    <div class="p_line">With the spiced wine the aged refresh them;</div>
    <div class="p_line">In it their youth and their vigor reviving,</div>
    <div class="p_line">But your own youth surely needs no concoction.”</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Even at the feasts where wine was permitted, its use was
limited by cautious restrictions. All meals and banquets were
subjected to rules of etiquette almost as rigorous as those which
the Court is accustomed to give its ambassadors. The careful
law is extended to the very preparation and serving of the
viands, and everywhere clips the wings of the art of cooking
and of drinking. If the Emperor U-tse gave his warriors a
banquet to gain their favor, he still preserved the most rigid
order of rank in the seating, and the food and the drink; and
the Emperor Tsi-she-hoang is praised for restoring the old
invitations and banquets, where every single ceremony took its
due course in beginning and end, so that a modest and decent
joy beamed in all eyes. To give a model for domestic feasts,
they order public ceremonies in all the cities; Mandarins preside
at them; the law invites scholars and distinguished citizens
to them; and here, too, the rites are prescribed down to the
minutest detail. The chief object of these feasts is to signalize
merit, to preserve morality, and the friendly as well as
conventional proprieties. The President reads aloud for that
purpose, in the name of the Emperor, certain paragraphs of the
law, the introduction to which specially calls to mind that the
gathering is not really made for the sake of the enjoyment of
meat and drink, but to revive loyalty to the Prince, and more
to the same effect; and all their songs and pieces of music
have reference to that. A single drinking-song, of somewhat
more liberal spirit, I found in the “Shi-King,” but in that
the translator may possibly have had a large share, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
in regard to the form. The contents are very characteristic of
Chinese poetry in general, whose bare realism offers a remarkable
contrast to that of the Orientals:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">“Water, the fresh,</div>
    <div class="p_line">Is drunk by the fish&mdash;</div>
    <div class="p_line">The carps and the pikes;</div>
    <div class="p_line">And each noble knight</div>
    <div class="p_line">At the board</div>
    <div class="p_line">Drinks water pure and bright.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">“Water, the fresh,</div>
    <div class="p_line">Is drunk by the fish&mdash;</div>
    <div class="p_line">The eels and the salmon;</div>
    <div class="p_line">You sad fellows all</div>
    <div class="p_line">At the board,</div>
    <div class="p_line">Drink, till for more ye shall call.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">“Water, the fresh,</div>
    <div class="p_line">Is drunk by the fish&mdash;</div>
    <div class="p_line">The perch and the barbel;</div>
    <div class="p_line">Ye good chums of mine</div>
    <div class="p_line">At the board,</div>
    <div class="p_line">Now drain ye the pearl of the wine.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">“Water, the fresh,</div>
    <div class="p_line">Is drunk by the fish&mdash;</div>
    <div class="p_line">The trout and the merlin;</div>
    <div class="p_line">But we boys gay and bold</div>
    <div class="p_line">At the board</div>
    <div class="p_line">Drain waves of the wine untold.”</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>But, even in their highest ecstasy, the brave drinkers still
preserve a sort of calmness; and if there is anything that can
be called a sober intoxication, this seems to be excellently
expressed in the following very characteristic song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">“Now our guests are growing tipsy;</div>
    <div class="p_line">Decency is at an end;</div>
    <div class="p_line">Sparks from out their eyes are darting,</div>
    <div class="p_line">And the babbling tongues unbend.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">“Crooked caps shake back and forward,</div>
    <div class="p_line">Hung but by a single hair;</div>
    <div class="p_line">Stiff old legs the dance are trying,</div>
    <div class="p_line">Hoarse old voices sing out fair.</div>
  </div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">“At the first cup which thou drainest,</div>
    <div class="p_line">Didst thou seem transformed to me;</div>
    <div class="p_line">If another now thou’dst empty,</div>
    <div class="p_line">Wholly tipsy wouldst thou be.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">“Truly thou dost shame me sorely;</div>
    <div class="p_line">Sober quite you see I stay;</div>
    <div class="p_line">But if thou wilt take me homeward,</div>
    <div class="p_line">Lead me gently on the way.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">“True, thou lead’st me into ditches,</div>
    <div class="p_line">But my own head reels at last;</div>
    <div class="p_line">Hold me by thy arm supported,</div>
    <div class="p_line">By thy pig-tail hanging fast.”</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>With this extreme point of drinking I will close. This
dull intoxication is about what a warm grain-wine would produce,
and fits the disagreeable character of the Chinese as
well as the anecdote occurring in another song, where one
whose invited guests do not appear at the right time, is
actually rejoiced to think he may now drink up his wine
alone. The value of wine for social enjoyment can scarcely
be known there, where conventionality ties the tongues, where
there is a tribunal of ceremonies, and where the tea-kettle is
forever on the fire, which among us, too, fosters only embroidery,
gossip and nervous debility. And then the greedy
desire for physical enjoyment is the one thing which makes
the Chinaman love his wine and his spicy concoctions, and
which in this point has ever driven him into a never-before-heard-of
opposition against his Government. How dreadful it
is, however, to see these crude and childish remnants of antiquated
customs most closely knit now with the most refined
and elaborate tastes, wants and habits thus in vogue among
the people, together with secret and most pernicious vices, and
yet to find that not a single voice can be raised against it, because,
with the most subtle cunning, down to the very limits
of physical needs, every expression of indignation or of joy
has been forbidden by law!</p>
